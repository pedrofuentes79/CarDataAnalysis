# Car Data Analysis


## Project 1: DougScore Analysis
This project is about analyzing the DougScore dataset and comparing the cars in there with the available cars in argentina (using MercadoLibre as the main source to check if a car is for sale or not, which may differ from reality but shows a good approximation).

The DougScore dataset is available [here](https://www.dougdemuro.com/dougscore)

## Project 2: Electric Engine Data Analysis
The second project is currently unfinished, but it's about analyzing electric engine data and predicting the torque applied based on normally available data in a production car.
